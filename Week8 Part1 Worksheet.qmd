# PSY6422 - Data Analysis & Visualisation
# Week 8: Introduction to R Markdown & Quarto Worksheet

Instructions:
1. Work directly in this .qmd file.
2. Read the comments and code comments (#) for guidance.
3. Fill in the missing code and text where indicated.
4. When finished, render to PDF.
-->
```

# Introduction

```{=html}
<!-- Write a short introduction to your report here.
Explain that you will include an image, load data from the web, and produce a plot and a table. -->
```

# Including an Image

```{=html}
<!-- 
Task:
1. Download an image from an open source. Suggested example:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png
2. Save it into a folder called "images" in your project.
3. Include it below using Markdown: ![Caption](path/to/image)
-->
```

# Introduction

This report demonstrates basic Quarto functionality for data analysis and visualisation. It includes an image, loads a dataset from the web, and produces a scatter plot and a summary table using R and the tidyverse.

# Including an Image

![Penguins at Palmer Station](images/lter_penguins.png)

# Data {#sec-data}

```{r}
#| label: load-data
library(tidyverse)
penguins <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins.csv")
penguins <- drop_na(penguins)
head(penguins)

```

# Visualisation

```{=html}
<!-- 
Task:
1. Create a scatter plot of bill length (x) vs bill depth (y).
2. Color the points by species.
3. Give the plot a descriptive title and axis labels.
-->
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-bills
#| fig-cap: "Bill length vs bill depth by species."
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Bill Length vs Bill Depth by Species",
    x = "Bill Length (mm)",
    y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
    color = "Species"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

# Summary Table

```{=html}
<!-- 
Task:
1. Group the data by species.
2. Calculate the mean bill length for each species.
3. Display the results as a table.
-->
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Mean bill length (mm) by species."
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  knitr::kable()

```

# Conclusion

```{=html}
<!-- Write 2–3 sentences summarising your findings.
Reference your figure and table using @fig-bills and @tbl-summary.
Also reference the data section using @sec-data.

The dataset loaded in @sec-data contains measurements of penguin species from Palmer Station.  
The scatter plot @fig-bills shows clear differences in bill dimensions across species.  
The summary table @tbl-summary confirms that Gentoo penguins have the longest average bill length. -->
